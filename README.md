# shape-nonlinear-spectral
This project contains the original implementation of the paper "Nonlinear Spectral Processing of Shapes via Zero-Homogeneous Flows"

https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/nonlinear-spectral-processing-of-shapes-via-zero-homogeneous-flo/19119118

by Jonathan Brokman and Guy Gilboa (SSVM 2021).

To reproduce results - 
1. Download folder "shape nonlinear spectral" .
2. Once downloaded, all contained scripts named "script_<some_suffix>.m" can run as is (we used MATLAB R2020a). 
Each script reproduces a results from the paper.

If you use our code - please cite our paper,

Enjoy!
