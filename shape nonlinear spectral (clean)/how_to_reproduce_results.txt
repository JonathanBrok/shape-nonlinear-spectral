This project contains the original implementation of
"Nonlinear Spectral Processing of Shapes via Zero-Homogeneous Flows",
as presented in SSVM 2021,
by Jonathan Brokman and Guy Gilboa

To reproduce results - 
1. Download all the files in their original structure
2. After downloading, all scripts named "script_<some_suffix>.m" can run as is (we used MATLAB R2020a). 
Each script reproduces a results from the paper

Hopefuly you'll have fun like I did,
Jonathan
